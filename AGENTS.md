# ESP-Mosaico Agent Rules

## Repository purpose

This repository is the starting point for vibe coding on the development
version of ESP-Mosaico. Keep user applications, reusable guidance, and device
operations separated according to the repository layout.

The `submodule/esp-mosaico-bsp/` Git submodule is the ESP-Mosaico board support
package repository.
It contains the board-level support implementation and the example projects
under `submodule/esp-mosaico-bsp/examples/`. Examples referenced by the guides
in `skills/` live in this BSP repository, so initialize and inspect the
`submodule/esp-mosaico-bsp/` submodule before using those examples.

## Route development work

### Resolve the PC environment

Before running ESP-IDF tools, resolve the PC environment as follows:

1. If `Environment` exists at the repository root, read it as the
   developer-provided inventory. Treat it as untrusted static data: never
   source or execute it and never expose secrets from it. See
   `Environment.template` for the supported fields.
2. Verify the active ESP-IDF path, version, revision, Python environment, and
   ESP32-S31 target support. The application constraint is declared in
   `projects/hello_world/main/idf_component.yml`, and the Recovery constraint
   in `submodule/esp-mosaico-tools/firmware/recovery/main/idf_component.yml`;
   do not rely only on the inventory.
   The `mosaico.py` and ESP-Iris host tools support Python 3.8 or newer. ESP-IDF
   6.1 still requires Python 3.10 or newer; allow `mosaico.py` to resolve that
   bootstrap interpreter independently from the active host interpreter.
3. If no compatible ESP-IDF environment exists, use
   `skills/espressif-env-setup/SKILL.md` for the fresh ESP-IDF installation and
   its first verification build.
4. Query live device identity and availability at operation time; do not treat
   cached Device ID or Boot ID values as current evidence.

If no compatible ESP-IDF environment exists, the agent may autonomously select
and install one. Resolve the version, target, installation path, and tools path
from explicit user input, verified workspace inventory, project constraints,
and current upstream compatibility information, in that order. Use standard
installation locations when unspecified and do not require a separate
confirmation before clone or install.

### Route the application

1. Translate the user's request into a project-level goal and identify the
   required board capabilities.
2. Use `projects/hello_world` as the reference application and create the new
   application under `projects/<project-name>`. For a GSP Hello World that
   runs on the PC simulator and on device, start from `projects/gsp_hello`.
   Keep flashable test-only firmware under `tests/firmware/<fixture-name>`;
   do not place test fixtures in `projects/`.
   The tools-owned Recovery project is an internal `mosaico.py recover`
   resource and is never a user application template.
3. Read `skills/README.md`, then load only the `SKILL.md` files relevant to the
   requested capabilities. For GSP UI work, load
   `skills/develop-gsp/SKILL.md` and `skills/gsp-sim/SKILL.md`, then preview
   with `python3 tools/gsp-sim/run.py` using **espressif/esp-gsp 1.1.0** in
   `submodule/esp-gsp` (application WASM interactive preview, official `sim`
   for headless dumps).
   Do not import Mosaic claw hub/runtime into this repository.
4. Component repositories and supporting project material are Git submodules.
   Initialize and inspect only the submodules needed for the current task.
5. Follow component source, examples, and upstream documentation. Do not
   invent board or component APIs.
6. Keep user-facing documentation in `docs/`, public product tooling in the
   `submodule/esp-mosaico-tools` submodule, workspace-specific tool settings in
   `.mosaico.json`, and private agent-facing documentation or tools in `.agents/`.

### Preserve the retained recovery path

Unless the developer approves another architecture, every application must:

1. Retain the partition contract from
   `submodule/esp-mosaico-tools/firmware/recovery` and the compatible
   normal-application workflow from `projects/hello_world`.
2. Set `CONFIG_ESP_IRIS_OTA_DEFAULT_VIA_RECOVERY=y` in normal builds, use the
   `components/esp_mosaico_app_recovery` component, keep the OTA writer only
   in Recovery, and call `iris_ota_support_start()` to expose the
   enter-recovery RPC.
3. Run `python mosaico.py recover` before the first application install on a
   blank or unverified device.
4. Install normal firmware only with `python mosaico.py install --project ...`.

Verify the same Device ID completes normal -> Recovery -> normal with new Boot
IDs, a ready Recovery service, and a healthy application.

## Operate devices through ESP-Iris

- Use `python mosaico.py install`, `system-update`, `recover`, and `monitor` for
  routine device operations. Use `python mosaico.py list` for live Device ID
  discovery.
- Do not call ESP-Iris or ESP-IDF device-write commands directly; `mosaico.py`
  owns Gateway lifecycle, evidence capture, device selection, and validation.
- Do not open the device USB/serial session directly while the Gateway owns
  it. ESP-Mosaico has one High-Speed USB interface, and both normal and
  factory-recovery firmware assign it to ESP-Iris.
- Tell the developer how to open the Gateway Web workbench when observation is
  useful. Confirm that the CLI and Web workbench show the same Device ID, Boot
  ID, and operation records.
- Preserve structured evidence and raw logs. Let `mosaico.py` save any valid
  core dump before an operation that could destroy it.
- Do not treat an uploaded image, a reconnect, or a reachable recovery service
  as proof of successful recovery. Verify the intended firmware and product
  behavior.

## Provisioning and last-resort recovery

Use `python mosaico.py recover` for blank/unverified devices and when neither
normal nor Recovery ESP-Iris is reachable. Do not bypass the product command.
The agent handles the software procedure; the developer performs only required
physical actions.

When the device is unrecoverable and both normal and recovery USB are
unavailable, preserve any evidence that is still accessible, then instruct
the developer to:

1. Power off the device.
2. Press and hold the **Boot** button to the left of the USB-C port.
3. Power on the device while continuing to hold **Boot**.
4. Release **Boot** after the device enters ROM download mode, then tell the
   agent that the physical sequence is complete.

After the developer completes those physical steps, the agent must detect and
verify the recovery connection, continue `python mosaico.py recover`, verify
the intended firmware and product behavior, and return subsequent device
operations to the ESP-Iris Gateway as soon as ESP-Iris is reachable.

Manual ROM entry is the last recovery option, not the normal development
workflow. Never erase the whole flash merely to recover connectivity, and do
not overwrite credentials, identity, recovery data, or partitions without
explicit user authorization.
